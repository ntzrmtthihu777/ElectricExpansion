Ok so basically what I had in mind is two models of machines: one electric, one kinetic (using fluids [mainly gasses]). The electric machines take electricity, and are obviously less efficient/slower based on both real world behavior and the need to balance. (Irl, it isn’t very efficient to take kinetic energy (gasoline or any heat-driven power), convert it to electricity, and then convert it back in a motor). So then we have the fluid-driven machines that operate using special pressurized fluids. Said fluids are just average, ordinary Forge fluids, without world blocks. They are produced inside the pressurizer, from their mundane or unpressurized counter-parts, using power or (in an upgraded/different version) (ironically) pressurized fluids to do (of course, this has a special input side, and is only once you already have some fluids by making some with the electric one; this is also mainly for efficiency and more “universalness” later-game.).
